title: Redis
---

>Redis (written in ANSI C) is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.

also referred as a data structure server(REmote DIctionary Server.)

Features

* NoSQL
* Transactions
	* serialized and atomic
	* corrupted log can remove the partial transaction and restart the server
	* check-and-set(CAS)(v2.2)
	* **does not support roll backs**
		* Redis commands can fail only if called with a wrong syntax,
		* or against keys holding the wrong data type
		* Redis is internally simplified and fast cause it does not need the ability to roll back
	* `MULTI;...;EXEC/DISCARD`
* Pub/Sub
* Lua scripting
* Keys with a limited time-to-live(ttl)
	* `EXPIRE key TTL`
* LRU eviction of keys
* Automatic failover
* LFU (Least Frequently Used) eviction mode (v4.0)

Limitations

* single threaded
* significant overhead for persistence

## Python

```python
import redis
import traceback

_redis = redis.StrictRedis(host='1.2.3.4', port=6379, db=0)
with _redis.pipeline() as pipe:
  pipe.setex('key', 60*2, 'value')
  try:
    pipe.execute()
  except Exception as e:
    traceback.print_exc()
```

## Cluster

Automatically shard across multiple Redis nodes.

Some degree of availability during partitions are provided:

* automatically split dataset among multiple nodes
* continue operations when a subset of the nodes are experiencing failures


### Port

Every Redis Cluster node requires **2** TCP connections open.

* 6379 serving the clients
* **10000+**6379 node-to-node communication channel (binary protocol)

## Sharding

Redis Cluster **does not** use consistent hashing.

16384 hash slots in Redis Cluster. Where every key is conceptually part of an hash slot.

```
hash_slot = CRC16(key)%16384
```

Every node in a Redis Cluster is responsible for a subset of the hash slots.

>
Redis Cluster supports multiple key operations as long as all the keys involved all belong to the same hash slot.
The user can force multiple keys to be part of the same hash slot by using a concept called hash tags.

>
If there is a substring between `{}` brackets in a key, only what is inside the string is hashed.
`this{foo}key` and `another{foo}key` are guaranteed to be in the same hash slot, and can be used together in a command with multiple keys as arguments.

## Master-slave model

In this model, every hash slot has 1 (the master) to N replicas (N-1 slave)

## Consistency

Redis Cluster is not able to guarantee **strong consistency**.
(means that Redis Cluster will lose writes that were acknowledged by the system to the client under specific conditions)

1. Redis Cluster uses asynchronous replication. (writer to master -> master ack OK to client -> master propates the write to its slaves)
(trade-off between performance and consistency.)

2. Redis Cluster has support for synchronous writes, implemented via the WAIT command.
(this makes losing writes a lot less likely, however, it's possible a slave that was not able to receive the write is elected as master)

3. Redis Cluster will lose writes during a network partition where a client is isolated with a minority of instances including at least a master
(write will lost only if the partition lasts enough time for the slave node to be promoted to master in the majority side of the partition)
Note that there is a **maximum window** to the amount of writes send to isolated master.
called **node timeout**. After node timeout has elapsed, a master node is considered to be failing, and can be replaced by one of its replicas.

### Redis Cluster Configuration

* `cluster-enabled <yes/no>`
* `cluster-config-file <filename>`
	* not the user editable config file, but the Redis Cluster persistent configration.
	* generated at startup by the Redis Cluster instances
* `cluster-node-timeout <milliseconds>`
	* Maximum amount of time a node can be unavailable before considered as failing.
* `cluster-slave-validity-factor <factor>`
* `cluster-migration-barrier <count>`
* `cluster-require-full-coverage <yes/no>`
	* if yes, the cluster stops accepting writes if some percentage of the key space is not covered by any node

#### Create Redis Cluster

```shell
for port in {7000..7005}; do
  path="cluster-x/$port"
  mkdir -p "$path"
  conf="$path/redis.conf"
  cat > "$conf" << EOF
port $port
cluster-enabled yes
cluster-config-file nodes.conf
cluster-node-timeout 5000
appendonly yes
EOF
  redis-server "$conf"
done

gem install redis
redis-trib.rb create --replicas 1 127.0.0.1:{7000..7005}

# alternate
create-cluster {start, create, stop}
```

## Failover

### Debug

`DEBUG SEGFAULT`

### Manual Failover

1. `CLUSTER FAILOVER` exec in one of the slaves whose master will be FAILOVER
2. clients connecting to master will be stopped
3. slave sync with master
4. slave and master switch
5. master redirect clients to new master

### Add A New Node

#### Add a node as master

1. Add an empty node
  * `redis-trib.rb add-node 127.0.0.1:7006 127.0.0.1:7000`
    * first check the state of the cluster before operate
    * sent a `CLUSTER MEET` message to the node
2. Reshard data to the node

#### Add a node as replica

* to random master
  `./redis-trib.rb add-node --slave 127.0.0.1:7006 127.0.0.1:7000`
* to specific master
  `./redis-trib.rb add-node --slave --master-id 3c3a0c74aae0b56170ccb03a76b60cfe7dc1912e 127.0.0.1:7006 127.0.0.1:7000`

#### Remove a node

`./redis-trib del-node 127.0.0.1:7000 <node-id>``

## Persistence

**in-memory dataset**

* dumping the dataset to disk every once a while
* appending each command to a log
* Persistence can be optionally disabled
* master-slave asynchronous replication, with very fast non-blocking first synchronization, auto-reconnection with partial resynchronization on net split.
